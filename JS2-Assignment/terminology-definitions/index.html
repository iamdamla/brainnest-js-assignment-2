        Why is it important to write clean code?
        <p>
          Writing clean code is important because it allows you to clearly
          communicate with the next person who works with what you've written.

        What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?

      <li>
        What is an array?
        <p>
          An array is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element
          specified by an index.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What are arrays useful for?
        <p>
          Array is a single variable that is used to store different elements.
          It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access
          them by a single variable.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How do you access an array element?
        <p>
          An item in an array is accessed by referring to the index number of
          the item in square brackets => someArray[1]
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How do you change an array element?
        <p></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What are some useful array properties?

        <p>splice(), toString(), unshift(), pop(), length(), push(), shift()</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What are some useful array methods?
        <p>filter(), forEach(), includes(), map(), sort(), reduce()</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What are loops useful for?
        <p>
          Loops are used to perform repeated tasks based on a condition.
          Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue
          running until the defined condition returns false .
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What is the break statement?
        <p>
          The break statement breaks out of a switch or a loop. In a switch, it
          breaks out of the switch block. This stops the execution of more code
          inside the switch. In in a loop, it breaks out of the loop and
          continues executing the code after the loop
        </p>
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        What is the continue statement?
        <p>
          The continue statement terminates execution of the statements in the
          current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues
          execution of the loop with the next iteration.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What is the DOM?
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
          documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
          document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the
          document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can
          interact with the page.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How do you target the nodes you want to work with?
        <p>
          document.querySelector(), querySelectorAll(),
          document.getElementById(), document.getElementByClassName(),
          getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByName().
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How do you create an element in the DOM?
        <p>const newDiv = document.createElement(div)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How do you add an element to the DOM?
        <p>const newP = document.createElement(p); newDiv.appendChild(newP)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How do you remove an element from the DOM?
        <p>
          First, select the target element that you want to remove using DOM
          methods such as querySelector(). Then, select the parent element of
          the target element and use the removeChild() method.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How can you alter an element in the DOM?
        <p>innerHTML, textContent, innerText</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        When adding text to a DOM element, should you use textContent or
        innerHTML?
        <p>textContent</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Where should you include your JavaScript tag in your HTML file when
        working with DOM nodes?
        <p>Before closing the body tag.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How do “events” and “listeners” work?
        <p>
          Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are
          programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react
          to them. The listener listens out for the event happening, and the
          handler is the code that is run in response to it happening.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are three ways to use events in your code?
        <p>Inline, using a property or using a listener</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Why are event listeners the preferred way to handle events?
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the benefits of using named functions in your listeners?
        <p>
          First, on bigger projects, it lets you separate your functions, which
          actually do things, from your event listeners, which trigger things.
          You may also want to run some code in multiple instances. A named
          function helps keep your code more DRY (an acronym for Don’t Repeat
          Yourself). Second, you can remove them later if you want using
          removeEventListener(). You cannot do this with anonymous functions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you attach listeners to groups of nodes?
        <p>With loops.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between the return values of querySelector and
        querySelectorAll?
        <p>
          querySelector is choosing one element from node, querySelectorAll is
          choosing all the elements that targeted and returns an array.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What does a “nodelist” contain?
        <p>
          A NodeList is a collection of document nodes (element nodes, attribute
          nodes, and text nodes). NodeList items can only be accessed by their
          index number.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain the difference between “capture” and “bubbling”.
        <p>
          Capturing phase – the event goes down to the element. Target phase –
          the event reached the target element. Bubbling phase – the event
          bubbles up from the element.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between objects and arrays?
        <p>
          Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used
          to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value).
          Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can
          also be used to store a list of values.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you access object properties?
        <p>
          const myBook = { author: Someone, year: 1903, name: Something }
          console.log(myBook) or myBook.author;
        </p>
      </li>
